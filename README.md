        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hindu temples in India are not just places of worship, but also rich cultural, historical, and architectural landmarks. They represent the spiritual journey of millions of people and reflect India's vast religious diversity. These temples are dedicated to various gods and goddesses in the Hindu pantheon, with each structure serving as a symbolic representation of divine energy and cosmic order.
        </p>
        <p>
            The temples vary greatly in style, size, and purpose, with some temples focusing on local deities, while others are dedicated to the major gods like Shiva, Vishnu, and Durga. The temple's architecture is an intricate blend of artistic styles, rich in symbolism and sacred geometry, each component having its own significance in the religious and spiritual context.

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of Hindu Temples</h2>
        <p>
            The history of Hindu temples in India dates back to the Vedic period (approximately 1500 BCE - 500 BCE), during which early forms of worship were practiced in open spaces, often around fire altars or sacred trees. However, it wasn't until the Maurya and Gupta empires (circa 3rd century BCE - 6th century CE) that the construction of stone temples began to gain prominence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The temples during the Gupta period are often regarded as the golden age of Hindu temple architecture, with several significant temple styles emerging. The temples built during this period were characterized by their square sanctum and pyramidal roof, which served as the foundation for the development of future architectural traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the centuries, Hindu temples continued to evolve in style and grandeur, reaching their peak during the Chola, Vijayanagara, and Rajput dynasties. The distinct regional styles of temple architecture that emerged during these periods still influence the design of modern temples today.

        <h2>Architecture of Hindu Temples</h2>
        <p>
            Hindu temples are built to represent the cosmos and are designed to evoke a sense of divine presence. The basic structure of a temple is divided into different parts, each with symbolic meaning. The main components include the <strong>garbhagriha</strong> (sanctum sanctorum), where the main deity resides, the <strong>shikhara</strong> (tower) which symbolizes the connection between earth and the divine, and the <strong>mandapa</strong> (hall) where devotees gather for prayers and rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Temples often feature intricate carvings and sculptures that depict gods, goddesses, and mythological stories. The layout is highly symbolic, with the temple being designed as a representation of the universe itself, where the sanctum is the center of cosmic energy. The temples also adhere to principles outlined in ancient texts like the <em>Vastu Shastra</em> and <em>Shilpa Shastra</em>, which provide detailed guidelines on temple construction and design.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are different architectural styles that are unique to various regions of India, such as the <strong>Nagara</strong> style of Northern India, the <strong>Dravida</strong> style of Southern India, and the <strong>Vesara</strong> style that blends both Northern and Southern styles.

    <section id="significance">
        <h2>Significance of Hindu Temples</h2>
        <p>
            Hindu temples are not merely places of worship but are vital centers of cultural and social life. They serve as community hubs, where people gather not only to pray but to celebrate festivals, participate in social events, and engage in religious education.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rituals performed at temples vary from simple daily prayers to elaborate ceremonies, with the primary goal being to establish a connection between the devotee and the divine. Temples are also considered sacred spaces where the devotee can experience spiritual liberation (Moksha).
        </p>
        <p>
            The significance of a temple also lies in its role as a protector of ancient traditions, art, and knowledge. Temples have been central to the preservation of Hindu scriptures, music, dance, and literature, contributing greatly to the cultural fabric of India.
